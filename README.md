## Developer Notes: Seed Data Wrapper Compilation

Book-level C# seed classes can be generated from chapter-range snippets in
`data/output/csharp` using:

```bash
python3 data/scripts/compile_book_wrappers.py \
  --input-dir data/output/csharp \
  --fallback-log-dir data/output/logs \
  --book 1John \
  --output backend/Koine.Infrastructure/Data/Seed/FirstJohnTextData.cs \
  --namespace Koine.Infrastructure.Data.Seed \
  --class-name FirstJohnTextData
```

Use `--dry-run` to validate input snippet quality without writing output.
The compiler reports malformed snippet files and verse-range gaps so they can
be regenerated before seeding.

For full data-generation details, see [`data/README.md`](data/README.md).

## Developer Notes: Refresh DB and Reseed

To reset the Docker SQL database and rerun backend seeding end-to-end:

```bash
./scripts/refresh-db-and-reseed.sh
```

What it does:
- Ensures `sqlserver` is running.
- Stops `backend`.
- Drops and recreates the `Koine` database.
- Recreates `backend` so startup seeding runs.
- Waits until logs contain `Database seeding completed successfully!`.

Optional environment overrides:
- `DB_CONTAINER` (default: `koine-db`)
- `DB_NAME` (default: `Koine`)
- `SA_USER` (default: `sa`)
- `SA_PASSWORD` (default: `YourStrong@Passw0rd`)
- `SEED_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default: `180`)
